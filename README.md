Hi, friend.

As you can tell from the numerous identifiers and links on this profile page,
I'm Mikael Gueck, a software architect from Helsinki.

You can reach me at gumi@iki.fi or +358405168122.

On this profile page you'll find a bunch of hobby projects I've worked on over the years,
in order to scratch an itch, or learn about one technology or another.

Some repos named "POC" or "repro" might exist to demonstrate some issue in a product,
or its use in general.

Professionally, I like to work on practical product development matters.

As a software architect, I'll tease out specs and requirements through discussion with customers,
clients and stakeholders, and help turn those into executable implementation and maintenance plans.

I'm at my best when the business focus for execution is on making sure that a small team is able
to concentrate on producing business value, rather than on extraneous complications. In practise,
this means carefully limiting the scope of work to that which is required by pressing business need,
and refraining to introduce complications, which will require an amount of maintenance that is not
in line with the business value they produce.

Taking part in practical software development, as a developer, is what I enjoy the most in my workday.
