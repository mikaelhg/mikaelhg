Hi, friend. You can reach me at gumi@iki.fi or +358405168122.

I'm a backend developer and architect working on modern stuff, 
mostly in the media and comms industries, since the late 90s. 

These are some of the hobby projects I've worked on over the years,
in order to scratch an itch, or learn about one technology or another.
Work stuff goes on a different account.
