Hi, friend. You can reach me at gumi@iki.fi or +358405168122.

On this profile page you'll find a bunch of hobby projects I've worked on over the years,
in order to scratch an itch, or learn about one technology or another.

Some repos named "POC" or "repro" might exist to demonstrate some issue in a product,
or its use in general.

As a software developer and architect, I tease out specs and requirements through discussion
with customers, clients and stakeholders, and help turn those into executable implementation
and maintenance plans. Then I do my part as a developer to execute those plans.

I support my team as an architect not by telling people what to do, but by asking questions,
and making sure that people have come up with their own answers, which they feel happy with,
regarding software development and business issues which are less obvious to people solving 
that kind of a problem for the first time, than to someone who's already made that mistake
and paid for it.
